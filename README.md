# React + Vite dashboard Prototype

Very general setup currently running in this skeletal prototype.
The build tool I am using is Vite.
Here is a list of all of the current Libraries being used.
├── @eslint/js@9.15.0
├── @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons@6.7.1
├── @fortawesome/react-fontawesome@0.2.2
├── @types/react-dom@18.3.1
├── @types/react@18.3.12
├── @vitejs/plugin-react@4.3.3
├── eslint-plugin-react-hooks@5.0.0
├── eslint-plugin-react-refresh@0.4.14
├── eslint-plugin-react@7.37.2
├── eslint@9.15.0
├── globals@15.12.0
├── list@2.0.19
├── react-dom@18.3.1
├── react-router-dom@7.0.1
├── react@18.3.1
└── vite@5.4.11

Most of these will be pre installed if you are creating the project with Vite.
One of the additional Packages from default were, though there might be a few others which I can't think of at the moment:
├── @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons@6.7.1
├── @fortawesome/react-fontawesome@0.2.2
└── list@2.0.19
